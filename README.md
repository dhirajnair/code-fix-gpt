## Configuration

Before running the application locally, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and include the following variable:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here


Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.
